						<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
						<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found <strong class="emphasis">passion</strong> in computer science and software development when I was a sophomore in college. I took an introduction programming class and kept on hacking and experimenting with different technologies especially with the web. I've listed out some past projects that I've worked on. In the beginning, I was just building static web apps using HTML, CSS, and Javscript. Then I started building web apps that is more full stack and dynamic using MEAN stack (Mongo/Mongoose/Express/Angular/Nodejs) and MeteorJs for quick prototyping.</p>

							<h3>Client Web Application</h3>
							<h4>Technologies Used: Angular JS, MongoDb, Express, Mongoose, Html, Javascript, CSS</h4>
							<p>Imported CSV client information and converted to JSON objects. Generated thumbnail images of each client website and stored all information into MongoDb. This web application then iterates through 800 clients and creates divs for each client with the client name, website url, thumbnail image, and also security input box. Architects of the company can update and rank the security of each website so that programmers can know what confidential information needs to be protected.</p>
							<p>Features: Search Box, A-Z pagination, Update Security Button, Modals</p>

							<h3>One North Redesign</h3>
							<h4>Technologies Used: Keystone, Angular, Handlebars, Sass</h4>
							<p>Coded the dynamic navigation scroller that populates based on the section title. Componentized all code into re-useable template code including hero, footer, main sections. Worked with three other developers and designer with an iterative design process mindset. Focused on the about and ideas page and added templates and content through keystone. Fixed bugs through BugsHerd software and located where and what the bugs are and kept a bug database. The whole redesign is an iterative process as we continue to receive feedback to change styling and added more functionality to the website to focus on branding. Added responsiveness and made it mobile-friendly</p>
							<p>Features: Consistent hero sections, page navigation scrollers, search function for blog posts, dynamic populated leadership section</p>

							<h3>Motivate Gym Application</h3>
							<h4>Technologies Used: Html, CSS, Javascript, Jquery</h4>
							<p>Mostly focused on front end development while designing the user interface. Conducted more than 20+ user interviews and testing to see what features are intuitive and what needs to be fixed. Motivate gym application allows users to challenge each other based on fitness goals and to keep track of individual fitness goals. This is just a prototype with the front-end of the web-app fully designed. </p>
							<p>Challenge friends for fitness goals, update progress, stats page, splash page</p>

							<h3>Recipe Parser</h3>
							<h4>Technologies Used: Python</h4>
							<p>Utilized natural language processing to parse through recipes on www.recipes.com to get important information. Organized all the ingredients into JSON objects and gave properties like sweetness, sourness, spiciness, bitterness. Then came up with an algorithm to swap the ingredients that are similar in these properties and mix ingredients to make a new dish. The three options are to make the dish healthier, change the cuisine style, and also alter cooking methods. 
							</p>
							<p>Features: Web scraper using Beautiful Soup, functions to swap cooking methods and ingredients</p>
